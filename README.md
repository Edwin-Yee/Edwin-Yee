- 👋 Hello! My name is @Edwin-Yee. I'm a sophomore pursuing my B.S. in computer science at UC Santa Barbara.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and discovering new topics! Recently, I've been exploring NLP technologies (BERT, GPT-3, QAG: Question-Answer Generation) and Machine Learning techniques. I love creating projects and hope to gain more hands-on software opportunities through internships.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about fundamental Machine Learning topics such as Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM. Over winter break, I have been expanding my knowledge of NoSQL, Docker, Hadoop, and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a summer internship for 2023 that is software engineering related. The best way to contact me would be through email at edwinyee@ucsb.edu. 
- 📫 How to reach me: edwinyee@ucsb.edu
