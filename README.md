- 👋 Hi, I’m @Edwin-Yee
- 👀 I’m interested learning and discovering new topics! Recently, I've been interested in exploring NLP technologies (BERT, GPT-3, QAG: Question-Answer Generation) and Machine Learning techniques. I love creating projects and hope to gain more hands-on software opportunities through internships.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about fundamental Machine Learning topics such as Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a summer internship that is software engineering related for the summer of 2023. My contact info in on the line below! 
- 📫 How to reach me: edwinyee@ucsb.edu
