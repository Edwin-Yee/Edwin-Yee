- 👋 Hello! My name is @Edwin-Yee. I'm a junior pursuing my B.S. in computer science at UC Santa Barbara.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and discovering new topics! In the past year, I've been exploring natural langauge processing technologies (BERT, ChatGPT), stable diffusion (Stability AI), and machine learning techniques. I love creating projects and hope to gain more hands-on software opportunities through internships.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about fundamental Machine Learning topics such as Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM. Over the summer, I have been expanding my knowledge of React, Javascript, and C# through YouTube tutorials, web resources, and learning by doing! 
- 💞️ I’m on the lookout for a software-engineering related internship for summer 2024. The best way to contact me would be through email at edwinyee@ucsb.edu.
